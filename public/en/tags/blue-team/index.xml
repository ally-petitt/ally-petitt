      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data Loss Prevention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-data-loss-prevention&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*65eSMdR110wv_HGg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

What is Data Loss Prevention?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a strategy for preventing data exfiltration and destruction. Examples of data include financial information, customer data, trade secrets, and other confidential information that could harm a company or its customers if exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common causes of data loss include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human error&lt;/strong&gt;- accidental deletion of sensitive files, misconfiguring security settings, or being the victim of a social engineering attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insider threats&lt;/strong&gt;- unauthorized saving and distribution of sensitive files by those with access to corporate systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware&lt;/strong&gt;- programs that infect a system and steal or corrupt data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical damage&lt;/strong&gt;- natural disasters, hardware failures, and power outages can all result in the loss of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theft or loss of devices&lt;/strong&gt;- data on the device at the time of being stolen/lost may be compromised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.sketchbubble.com/pub/media/catalog/product/optimized1/7/f/7f3f224484e9abfed723832a1fee08a73cdf27c9b5eb2b177a645fcc3c2c7261/data-loss-prevention-slide2.png&#34;&gt;https://cdn.sketchbubble.com/pub/media/catalog/product/optimized1/7/f/7f3f224484e9abfed723832a1fee08a73cdf27c9b5eb2b177a645fcc3c2c7261/data-loss-prevention-slide2.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Classification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data classification falls under the broad umbrella of data governance. This is essentially the process of determining which data is considered to be sensitive so that it can be protected. It is an important prerequisite step to a successful DLP program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Mapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the process of determining how data is transferred, where data is stored, how it is processed, and who has access to it. The goal of data mapping is to create a comprehensive inventory of an organization’s data assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is often in one of two states: in transit or at rest. It is typical that an audit will be performed on all the systems and applications that contain data at rest including file servers, cloud storage, databases, email systems, and other data repositories. Once this has been completed, it is common to create a map illustrating the flow of data through an organization. This includes identifying how data is processed, transmitted, and stored, as well as who has access to it at each stage of the process. The information collected through data mapping can be used to develop DLP policies and controls to protect sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data protection involves implementing controls in order to maintain the confidentiality of the information classified in step 1. Common data protection methods include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;- the robustness and scope of encryption used will be determined by the assets that it is aiming to protect and how sensitive they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access Control&lt;/strong&gt;- limiting user permissions, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA), and potentially monitoring user behavior to detect suspicious activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Policy&lt;/strong&gt;- social media policy, clear desk policy, acceptable use policy, and end user policy are all potential ways to enforce operational security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee Training&lt;/strong&gt;- employees should be trained on data handling best practices, strong password policy, and identifying social engineering schemes. Regular awareness campaigns can reinforce the importance of data security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial tools can be used to prevent data loss the methods mentioned previously. DLP software can be found from cloud platforms and email providers as native implementations. Commercial solutions include Symantec CloudSOC CASB, Symantec DLP, McAfee Total Protection for DLP, and Digital Guardian to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained by CloudFlare, DLP solutions may detect sensitive data through data fingerprinting, keyword matching in files, pattern matching, file matching, and exact data matching. By comparing the unique identifiers of sensitive data, the software is able to determine whether the sensitive data is being exfiltrated and enact measures to prevent it. For example, the DLP program may block suspicious outgoing emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data loss prevention is an essential element of any organization’s cybersecurity strategy, as it helps protect sensitive data from loss or theft. By implementing a comprehensive DLP program, organizations can reduce the risk of data breaches and maintain the trust of their customers and stakeholders. However, it’s important to remember that DLP requires ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and improvement to ensure its effectiveness over time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NYCBo5F_MGeRvxzrEm1hsg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article contains information that I have gathered as I’ve done research on incident response. This aims to be actionable for red teamers to know what to look out for and for blue teamers to aid in the creation of an effective incident response plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;key-roles&#34;&gt;Key Roles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the CISO ensures cyberattacks are promptly investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coordinating efforts of incident response during a cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;investigating which data may have been stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;containing and securing compromised systems to prevent further damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;working with stakeholders to determine incident response plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this role involves ensuring all steps of a data exposure management plan are completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reviewing applicable privacy laws with the General counsel and creating plans of action to ensure that the laws are adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Incident Response Coordinator will update the CISO and members about new events as they take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;provide guidance and directing effort in information gathering and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gathering and documenting findings of security systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;documenting procedural information and appropriate data for Incident Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;providing expert opinions in data and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ERT consists of officials with the authority to make key decisions in Incident Response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May consist of CISO, privacy officer, General Counsel, Representative(s) from the Office of the President, and head of the organization where the cyber incident occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-preparation&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*b6BEiI2FjVfUf6e-zduodQ.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image outlining steps in incident response&#34;  /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;1. Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure there are people on the incident response team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the team is trained and has access to the services that they would need in the case of an incident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have drills simulating an attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a plan/playbook for the Security Operations team containing steps and actions to take when compromised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-identification&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Identification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find ways to detect deviations in the regular functioning of an application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software for this can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IDS/IPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Incident Event Manager (SIEM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endpoint detection &amp;amp; response (EDR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alerts will typically be addressed by a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst who will assess whether there is a threat or a false alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suspicious behavior might include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unusual behavior from privileged attacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unauthorized users trying to access servers and data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anomalies in outbound network traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic sent to or from unknown locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive consumption of computing resources. Can be a sign of cryptojacking or running a heavy program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes in configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unexpected changes like users getting locked out of their accounts or memberships changing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suspicious registry entries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify where the attacker initially got in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify what programs were uploaded, which files were changed, which new processes are running, and if any new registry keys were created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Containment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevent any further damage from occurring by containing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-term&lt;/strong&gt; containment is isolating the affected devices from the rest of the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term&lt;/strong&gt; containment may involve taking an image of the device and performing hard-disk forensics. For this you would want a Digital forensics analyst. This can be necessary when a deeper analysis is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Eradication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undoing the changes that the adversary made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing patches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disarming malware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disabling compromised accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to normal service in the business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If clean backups are available, these can be used to restore service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compromised devices will need rebuilding to ensure recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affected devices may need additional monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Lessons learned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the final stage of incident response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a post-incident review (PIR), or a meeting where representatives from each team discuss what went well and what could be improved. This is where the incident response plan can be refined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<li>Have drills simulating an attack</li>
<li>Create a plan/playbook for the Security Operations team containing steps and actions to take when compromised.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="2-identification"><strong>2. Identification</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>Find ways to detect deviations in the regular functioning of an application</li>
</ul>
<p>Software for this can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IDS/IPS</li>
<li>Security Incident Event Manager (SIEM)</li>
<li>Endpoint detection &amp; response (EDR)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alerts will typically be addressed by a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst who will assess whether there is a threat or a false alarm.</p>
<p>Suspicious behavior might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unusual behavior from privileged attacks</li>
<li>Unauthorized users trying to access servers and data</li>
<li>Anomalies in outbound network traffic</li>
<li>Traffic sent to or from unknown locations</li>
<li>Excessive consumption of computing resources. Can be a sign of cryptojacking or running a heavy program</li>
<li>Changes in configuration</li>
<li>Hidden files</li>
<li>Unexpected changes like users getting locked out of their accounts or memberships changing</li>
<li>Suspicious registry entries</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify where the attacker initially got in.</p>
<p>Identify what programs were uploaded, which files were changed, which new processes are running, and if any new registry keys were created.</p>
<p><strong>3. Containment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent any further damage from occurring by containing it.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term</strong> containment is isolating the affected devices from the rest of the network.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term</strong> containment may involve taking an image of the device and performing hard-disk forensics. For this you would want a Digital forensics analyst. This can be necessary when a deeper analysis is required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Eradication</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Undoing the changes that the adversary made</li>
<li>Installing patches</li>
<li>Disarming malware</li>
<li>Disabling compromised accounts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Recovery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Return to normal service in the business.</li>
<li>If clean backups are available, these can be used to restore service</li>
<li>Compromised devices will need rebuilding to ensure recovery</li>
<li>Affected devices may need additional monitoring</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Lessons learned</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is the final stage of incident response.</li>
<li>Have a post-incident review (PIR), or a meeting where representatives from each team discuss what went well and what could be improved. This is where the incident response plan can be refined.</li>
</ul>
