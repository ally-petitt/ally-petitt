      <description>Author: Ally Petitt
Introduction Christmas break is notoriously refreshing for high schoolers like myself, however, unlike most high school students, I got to spend mine doing the most fascinating work in the world: security research.
I had previously used Savannah, a GNU bug tracker, to submit a bug report, so when I noticed that the underlying technology, Savane, was open source, I knew I had to put it on my list of research projects.</description>

Introduction Whitebox penetration testing can be intimidating. Complex web applications may contain hundreds of thousands of lines of code and deciphering the connection between the various web components and their numerous implementations is challenging. A powerful, yet simple technique to approach the code review of such an application is to break it into manageable pieces.
In this article, I will be outlining a methodology that can be used to break down large web applications, such as Content Management Systems (CMSs) into manageable components that can be systematically analyzed for vulnerabilities or logic errors.</description>

Introduction Linux users often take pride in their ability to compile their own code. In spite of this, a subtle yet critical attack vector has existed for over 20 years with high potential impact when exploited. Cleverly disguised within the configure.ac file, this attack vector allows malicious actors to execute code on your system before the compilation process even begins.
While the absence of known exploits may lull users into a false sense of security, it is precisely this lack of awareness that makes this attack vector dangerous, increasing the chances of successful and large-scale exploitation.</description>

Introduction Discovering a CVE was always an idea that enticed me, but I had no idea how to achieve it. Encountering the authentication bypass that I will explain in this article was both unexpected and deeply inspiring. In my preparation for the OSWE, I decided to practice identifying the exam vulnerabilities in real, open-source applications, which would both give me practice for the exam and enable me to contribute to the security community.</description>

      <description>Introduction Firmware is a critical component of electronic devices. It is the program that is installed on embedded systems that defines their functionality. Firmware is responsible for initializing the hardware components as the computer boots up, enabling the device to function properly.
Attacks against firmware have been of increasing interest to hackers due to their relative ease to exploit in a world of increasingly more secure application- and network-layer security practices.</description>

      <description>Computer Forensics for File Recovery https://edgy.app/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dataleakhackerGorodenkoff-970x546.jpg
Introduction When a file is “deleted”, its contents aren’t typically erased from the storage device that it was stored on. More often than not, the blocks that stored the file are marked as unallocated and the filesystem pointers are removed from it. The implication is that the file still exists on the disk until it is overwritten.
There are many methods to recovering the raw, unallocated data.</description>

      <description>Introduction Snort is an open source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that detects malicious network traffic by comparing the network packets to a set of rules, often created by Snort and the community. Snort can be used as a packet sniffer, packet logger, and intrusion prevention system.
In this article, I’ll go over some of the first steps of installing, configuring, and running Snort so that new users have a place to branch off of.</description>

      <description>Data Loss Prevention
What is Data Loss Prevention? Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a strategy for preventing data exfiltration and destruction. Examples of data include financial information, customer data, trade secrets, and other confidential information that could harm a company or its customers if exposed.
Common causes of data loss include:
Human error- accidental deletion of sensitive files, misconfiguring security settings, or being the victim of a social engineering attack. Insider threats- unauthorized saving and distribution of sensitive files by those with access to corporate systems.</description>

      <description>Hi guys, I made a mistake. In my frustration trying to debug my C program, I inadvertently deleted all the files within my /usr/include folder. I didn’t realize at the time that this was a very important folder! As explained here, it stores the Linux kernel’s libc header files! Rookie mistake, but luckily for us, there’s ways to fix it.
If your /usr/include folder is also looking more empty than the shelves during COVID, I come bearing the solution.</description>

      <description>Why Create a Cloud Server? As many security-conscious people are aware, saving something in the cloud really means saving it on somebody else’s computer. When using cloud services, you don’t own the data that you upload, nor do you own the program that you’re using. Additionally, it is within the cloud service provider’s rights to delete your data or remove your access to it if they had technical issues, went bankrupt, or you missed a bill.</description>

      <description>Wait, you can do that? The answer is a resounding “yes”. And I’m not the only one who got my OSCP at the age of 16. Meet Mihai, Vanshal, Grant, and this person from Reddit. Admittedly, the number of us is few and far between when compared to the typical demographic of OSCP test-takers. To add to this, I’m a woman and I haven’t seen any other women my age do this.</description>

If you’re anything like me, you discovered Impacket, either through a course, Ippsec, or your own research, and you look at the scripts. Your grin turns into horror as you realize the sheer amount of scripts that end with “exec”. They all give you remote access but when do you use which one!? Don’t worry, I have your back. Let’s break them down.
PsExec PsExec works by writing a randomly-named binary to the ADMIN$ SMB share (hence why you require write access to that share in order to use it).</description>

      <description>The Pen-200 is the prerequisite course for the OSCP exam. As such, the writeups for the labs are incredibly difficult to find. As someone who has relied heavily on the accessibility of HTB walkthroughs, I’ve never been in an environment where I wasn’t one Google search away from figuring out the next step in solving a box. Needless to say, 0xdf couldn’t help me much with the Pen-200 labs.
The Pen-200 labs were a struggle not because I was incompetent, but because I didn’t have enough practice reaching dead ends.</description>

      <description>An 18-year-old hacker gained admin access to Uber on September 15, 2022. These are the steps that the hacker took:
The hacker obtained an Uber employee’s phone number. He directed the employee to a phishing site that looked like an Uber login page. The employee logged in and the hacker gained his credentials. The hacker tried to get around the MFA by doing a Multi-Factor Authentication Fatigue attack. This attack consists of spamming MFA requests to the employee until he gets annoyed enough to allow the login attempt to go through.</description>

      <description>Foreword To avoid detection, it is best to use tools that are native to the victim’s computer.
FTP with Windows Host While having a shell on the Windows machine, start an FTP server on your host machine. Follow these steps if you don’t already have FTP server installed:
sudo apt-get install vsftpd sudo service vsftpd start service vsftpd status #status should be active To check if your server is working, type ftp localhost.</description>

      <description>How Does Antivirus Software Actually Work? Antivirus software acts as a defense from trojans, viruses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and much more. There are 3 main ways that it detects malware: signature-based detection, heuristic-based detection, and anomaly-based detection.
Signature-Based Detection The scanner will search for specific strings in a program and check for them in a database of known viruses. The strings are often the payload of the malicious code. If the signatures match, the activity is flagged for suspicious activity.</description>

      <description>When first learning Kerberos, it can feel like you’re being chased by the three-headed dog. Not to fear, however, because today I’ll be explaining a high-level overview of Kerberos authentication. Kerberos was designed to provide secure authentication to services over a potentially insecure network. It is used by many organizations to implement single sign-on (SSO).
Kerberos Terminology In order to understand the step-by-step explanation, it is important to have a basic understanding of the various components of Kerberos.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hey everyone! This is a write-up of how I was able to pwn the Mustacchio machine. I hope you enjoy!
Notes: This was done on a Kali Linux machine so the commands might be slightly different if you are on Windows Enumeration To begin, I scanned for open ports using RustScan. RustScan, for those who have never heard of it, is essentially a much faster version of Nmap. You can use Nmap if you prefer.</description>
