<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>Hello everyone and welcome to the first exclusive post on my new personal website! I am very excited to be here and I hope that you are as well. The picture above is a bit dramatic, but communicates the message that I have decided to move forward. Those who have been following me will know that I first began my technical blog on Medium, which was an approachable outlet for sharing my knowledge as I first entered the field.</p>
<p>I will graduate from high school this month, which marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life. In the spirit of this transitional period of my life, I decided to make the shift from posting my technical articles on Medium to this personal website.</p>
<p>The technical details of how I migrated my blogs from Medium to here will be explained further down in this article.</p>
<h3 id="appreciation">Appreciation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#appreciation">#</a></h3>
<p>I want to first express my gratitude for Medium and the supportive readers that the platform has allowed me to connect with. Medium is where I got my start in writing technical blogs and has been an instrumental outlet in sharing my knowledge as I was learning it.</p>
<h2 id="why-im-leaving-medium">Why I&rsquo;m Leaving Medium<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-im-leaving-medium">#</a></h2>
<p>With that in mind, my decision to leave Medium is multi-faceted.</p>
<p>Not only am I ascending into adulthood, I am maturing into a professional career doing work that I am extremely passionate about. I wanted that increased seriousness to be reflected in the articles that I write, which is more aptly served by a personal website than Medium (even more so with a custom domain, but that is a work in progress).</p>
<p>Additionally, this website offers a more authentic experience. I have purposefully omitted analytics for the benefit of my readers&rsquo; privacy. As a result, these posts are more like a conversation with interested readers than a numbers game.</p>
<p>Finally, creating my own website affords me autonomy. My readers are no longer berated by banners and pop-ups to subscribe to get a Medium membership so that they can view other content on the site with the vast majority of it being pay-walled. I can provide my readers with a site that is free to access without distractions- something that I have come to appreciate in my own internet browsing.</p>
<p>I also understand that I have readers that prefer stay updated with their authors through RSS feed aggregators. For you, I added an <a href="https://ally-petitt.github.io/ally-petitt/index.xml">RSS feed</a> to the site :).</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#next-steps">#</a></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-wpfsx/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/04/09234832/commencement-topper-Image-2024-scaled.jpeg" alt="Picture of a graduation"  />
</p>
<p>I am excited about the future. I used to be petrified about life after graduation, but I have learned to embrace the unknown. There is so much to learn, attempt, and experience and I am at this exciting point in my life where it is all novel. There are certain topics in cybersecurity that I wish I could re-learn again for the first time because I remember the potent feelings awe and inspiration of the moment I first read about them. Here&rsquo;s to a future of continued discovery.</p>
<p>Regarding this blog, as I continue to perform security research and study new techniques, I plan to publish writeups or otherwise educational content. Writing will not be my main focus, so I will prioritize the articles I write based on what I find very interesting or if I think my audience would benefit from them.</p>
<h2 id="creating-this-website">Creating This Website<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#creating-this-website">#</a></h2>
<p>I was recommended the static site generator, Hugo, by a colleague who I was discussing website-building with. After setting up a Hugo app, I found appreciation in the ease of setup and its customizability and decided to build this website to completion with it.</p>
<p>Since there are already a plethora of tutorials for Hugo, I will omit the initial app setup (those that are interested can view Hugo&rsquo;s <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">QuickStart Guide</a>). Instead, I will focus on the technical challenges that were specific to this use case of converting a personal Medium blog to a Hugo-compatible markdown post.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-transferred-previous-blog-posts">How I Transferred Previous Blog Posts<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-i-transferred-previous-blog-posts">#</a></h3>
<p>I had 26 published blogs on my Medium account, so transferring each manually would have taken an immense amount of time. Consequently, I used scripts to automate this process. The first was a tool developed by Oliver Ernst called <a href="https://github.com/smrfeld/medium-to-markdown">medium-to-markdown</a>. The second was a tool was developed by myself: <a href="https://github.com/ally-petitt/medium-to-hugo-post">medium-to-hugo-post</a>.</p>
<p>My workflow involved chaining both of these scripts together such that the output directory of <code>medium-to-markdown</code> was the input directory of <code>medium-to-hugo-post</code> with <code>/md</code> appended. As per the README instructions on <code>medium-to-markdown</code>, I requested an export of my data from Medium, which I then fed into <code>medium-to-markdown</code>. This converted my posts into markdown with the exception of image tags and their captions.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>python3 ./medium-to-markdown/run.py convert --posts-dir ./export/posts --output-dir ./output
</code></pre><p>Following the markdown conversion, I noticed that the new markdown files required additional modifications to properly format on Hugo. To remedy this, I created <code>medium-to-hugo-post</code> to add a &ldquo;<a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">Front Matter</a>&rdquo; to each post and finalize the conversion of images and their subtitles to markdown.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>python3 ./medium-to-hugo-post/medium-to-hugo-post.py --md-dir ./output/md --posts-dir ./content/posts
</code></pre><p>I outline these steps and the limitations of these tools in more detail in the medium-to-hugo-post <a href="https://github.com/ally-petitt/medium-to-hugo-post/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a> file.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h3>
<p>Migrating to this website is a symbol of a new beginning. I could not be more enthusiastic about this transformative period of my life as I transition into a full-time career doing the work that I love. Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what the future has in store!</p>
