      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/ally-petitt/ally-petitt/images/Medium-crossed.png&#34; alt=&#34;Medium logo crossed out&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone and welcome to the first exclusive post on my new personal website! I am very excited to be here and I hope that you are as well. The picture above is a bit dramatic, but communicates the message that I have decided to move forward. Those who have been following me will know that I first began my technical blog on Medium, which was an approachable outlet for sharing my knowledge as I first entered the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will graduate from high school this month, which marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life. In the spirit of this transitional period of my life, I decided to make the shift from posting my technical articles on Medium to this personal website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical details of how I migrated my blogs from Medium to here will be explained further down in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appreciation&#34;&gt;Appreciation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to first express my gratitude for Medium and the supportive readers that the platform has allowed me to connect with. Medium is where I got my start in writing technical blogs and has been an instrumental outlet in sharing my knowledge as I was learning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-im-leaving-medium&#34;&gt;Why I&amp;rsquo;m Leaving Medium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, my decision to leave Medium is multi-faceted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only am I ascending into adulthood, I am maturing into a professional career doing work that I am extremely passionate about. I wanted that increased seriousness to be reflected in the articles that I write, which is more aptly served by a personal website than Medium (even more so with a custom domain, but that is a work in progress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this website offers a more authentic experience. I have purposefully omitted analytics for the benefit of my readers&amp;rsquo; privacy. As a result, these posts are more like a conversation with interested readers than a numbers game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, creating my own website affords me autonomy. My readers are no longer berated by banners and pop-ups to subscribe to get a Medium membership so that they can view other content on the site with the vast majority of it being pay-walled. I can provide my readers with a site that is free to access without distractions- something that I have come to appreciate in my own internet browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also understand that I have readers that prefer stay updated with their authors through RSS feed aggregators. For you, I added an &lt;a href=&#34;https://ally-petitt.github.io/ally-petitt/index.xml&#34;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; to the site :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-wpfsx/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/04/09234832/commencement-topper-Image-2024-scaled.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture of a graduation&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am excited about the future. I used to be petrified about life after graduation, but I have learned to embrace the unknown. There is so much to learn, attempt, and experience and I am at this exciting point in my life where it is all novel. There are certain topics in cybersecurity that I wish I could re-learn again for the first time because I remember the potent feelings awe and inspiration of the moment I first read about them. Here&amp;rsquo;s to a future of continued discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding this blog, as I continue to perform security research and study new techniques, I plan to publish writeups or otherwise educational content. Writing will not be my main focus, so I will prioritize the articles I write based on what I find very interesting or if I think my audience would benefit from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-this-website&#34;&gt;Creating This Website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recommended the static site generator, Hugo, by a colleague who I was discussing website-building with. After setting up a Hugo app, I found appreciation in the ease of setup and its customizability and decided to build this website to completion with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there are already a plethora of tutorials for Hugo, I will omit the initial app setup (those that are interested can view Hugo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/&#34;&gt;QuickStart Guide&lt;/a&gt;). Instead, I will focus on the technical challenges that were specific to this use case of converting a personal Medium blog to a Hugo-compatible markdown post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-i-transferred-previous-blog-posts&#34;&gt;How I Transferred Previous Blog Posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had 26 published blogs on my Medium account, so transferring each manually would have taken an immense amount of time. Consequently, I used scripts to automate this process. The first was a tool developed by Oliver Ernst called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/smrfeld/medium-to-markdown&#34;&gt;medium-to-markdown&lt;/a&gt;. The second was a tool was developed by myself: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ally-petitt/medium-to-hugo-post&#34;&gt;medium-to-hugo-post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My workflow involved chaining both of these scripts together such that the output directory of &lt;code&gt;medium-to-markdown&lt;/code&gt; was the input directory of &lt;code&gt;medium-to-hugo-post&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;/md&lt;/code&gt; appended. As per the README instructions on &lt;code&gt;medium-to-markdown&lt;/code&gt;, I requested an export of my data from Medium, which I then fed into &lt;code&gt;medium-to-markdown&lt;/code&gt;. This converted my posts into markdown with the exception of image tags and their captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 ./medium-to-markdown/run.py convert --posts-dir ./export/posts --output-dir ./output
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the markdown conversion, I noticed that the new markdown files required additional modifications to properly format on Hugo. To remedy this, I created &lt;code&gt;medium-to-hugo-post&lt;/code&gt; to add a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/&#34;&gt;Front Matter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; to each post and finalize the conversion of images and their subtitles to markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 ./medium-to-hugo-post/medium-to-hugo-post.py --md-dir ./output/md --posts-dir ./content/posts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I outline these steps and the limitations of these tools in more detail in the medium-to-hugo-post &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ally-petitt/medium-to-hugo-post/blob/main/README.md&#34;&gt;README.md&lt;/a&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrating to this website is a symbol of a new beginning. I could not be more enthusiastic about this transformative period of my life as I transition into a full-time career doing the work that I love. Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what the future has in store!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Create and Deploy Your Own Cloud Server with NextCloud</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/ally-petitt/posts/2023-04-09_how-to-create-and-deploy-your-own-cloud-server-with-nextcloud-345e185d602a/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/ally-petitt/posts/2023-04-09_how-to-create-and-deploy-your-own-cloud-server-with-nextcloud-345e185d602a/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-create-a-cloudserver&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-WVjY5h4EpphjjX7&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

Why Create a Cloud Server?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many security-conscious people are aware, saving something in the cloud really means saving it on somebody else’s computer. When using cloud services, you don’t own the data that you upload, nor do you own the program that you’re using. Additionally, it is within the cloud service provider’s rights to delete your data or remove your access to it if they had technical issues, went bankrupt, or you missed a bill. Not all of them will do that, but there is no law protecting the customer from something like this happening. There aren’t any measures in place to prevent the government or corporations from looking through your data and using it for their own objectives (in the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from data security, creating your cloud server provides the opportunity to learn more about how cloud storage works, get practice with hosting a docker container and connecting to it on your LAN, and challenge yourself to do something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-nextcloud&#34;&gt;Why NextCloud&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextCloud is free and open source. They do not collect or share any of your data. For the paranoid, you can audit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nextcloud&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; yourself to verify this. The cost of a NextCloud server will be limited to the of the infrastructure that you’re using to host it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-setup&#34;&gt;My Setup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this demonstration, I’ll be hosting the NextCloud server in a Kali Linux virtual machine. Although I’m using Kali, you can do this on any operating system that allows you to download Docker. I’ll be accessing it through other devices on my LAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;creating-your-docker-container&#34;&gt;Creating Your Docker Container&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, if you don’t already have docker installed, you can find the release for your operating system here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/&#34;&gt;https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pull-and-run-the-nextcloud-container&#34;&gt;Pull and run the NextCloud container&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the versions of NextCloud that are available to you, visit their docker website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud&#34;&gt;https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yVUBpaz7cPnubERvyi-o7w.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

In this example, I’ll be using version 24.0.11, but you can substitute with whichever version you’re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo docker pull nextcloud:24.0.11
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output of that command will look like this once it is completed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GN-cYnfs54AiOogx8-NAQw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

Next, I’ll start the container and bind it to port 80 on my Kali VM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo docker run --name my\_cloud -d -p 80:80 nextcloud:24.0.11 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--name&lt;/code&gt; will set the container name to be &lt;code&gt;my_cloud&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; will run the container in detached mode. This means that the container will run in the background of my terminal instead of displaying all the output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt; allows for port-binding from port 80 of the docker container to port 80 of the machine that the container is running on so that we can access it in the browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, visiting &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;http://localhost:80&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the browser of my Kali VM leads to the NextCloud web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;setting-up-nextcloud-foruse&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*09ClzbW6QlZFUKeE8VCFqw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

Setting up NextCloud for use&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-adminaccount&#34;&gt;Create Admin Account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the initial homepage says, you can create an admin account by entering your desired credentials into the login form. Then click the install button below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NCg8BFzJsn7Q8DSYJc22gw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

You will be prompted with a screen that optionally allows you to install reccomended apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-useraccount&#34;&gt;Create User Account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each user of NextCloud will only be able to view their respective files. To create a user account, click on your profile picture and click &lt;code&gt;Users&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rpUr6mASFndr9leQFgxjSw.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

Then, click the &lt;code&gt;New user&lt;/code&gt; button in the upper-righthand corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XZ6nK22WFx20KFCEcIweNg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

Fill in the form that appears with your desired information. and click &lt;code&gt;Add a new user&lt;/code&gt;. You can verify that the user was added by logging out of your administrator account and logging in with the user credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whitelisting-domains&#34;&gt;Whitelisting Domains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we’ll need to configure the NextCloud server so that we can access it from other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to know your IP address. I use the &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; command on my Kali VM to determine. Windows users can use &lt;code&gt;ipconfig&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EPZQQ90fBx0es5jESHsJQg.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

I’ll install vim as a text editor so that I can edit the config files easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]  
└─$ sudo docker exec -it my\_cloud bash   
root@f6d476ccd902:/var/www/html# apt update  
-- snip --  
root@f6d476ccd902:/var/www/html# apt install -y vim  
-- snip --  
root@f6d476ccd902:/var/www/html# vim config/config.php
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your &lt;code&gt;config/config.php&lt;/code&gt; file, add the option of &lt;code&gt;trusted_domains&lt;/code&gt; at the bottom, starting on line 21 (type &lt;code&gt;:set number&lt;/code&gt; in vim to show line numbers). This option will allow you to connect to the NextCloud server through different domain names. Without this option, you would not be able to use your server through a domain name besides localhost, which is not ideal if you’re trying to access it remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;#39;trusted\_domains&amp;#39; =&amp;gt;  
 [  
 &amp;#39;localhost&amp;#39;,  
 &amp;#39;127.0.0.1&amp;#39;,  
 &amp;#39;&amp;lt;YOUR IP ADDRESS&amp;gt;&amp;#39;,  
 &amp;#39;&amp;lt;YOUR DOMAIN NAME (optional)&amp;gt;&amp;#39;,  
 ],
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RFzQIvqVYLkE7HLgJ2eciA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

Now, I can use my NextCloud server from 192.168.1.53, 127.0.0.1, and localhost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; You can optionally choose to configure your own database. The documentation for doing that can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_database/linux_database_configuration.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;connecting-from-otherdevices&#34;&gt;Connecting From Other Devices&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pc&#34;&gt;PC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect from you PC, just type in the IP address of your NextCloud server into your browser and type in your login credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mobile&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YSMzF6AAy_s1ddUyTn1fRA.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also connect to the website from your phone. Alternatively, you can download the NextCloud app, available in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nextcloud/id1125420102&#34;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nextcloud/id1125420102&#34;&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. Just type the same URL into the app that you would type in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rXIb7WPys_Tqgbh_&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;  /&gt;

Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextCloud allows for a tremendous amount of flexibility. There are many configurations that you can set including brute force protection, antivirus scanning, OAuth2, and more as shown in &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/index.html&#34;&gt;their documentation&lt;/a&gt;. I hope that you got value out of this article and were inspired to take control of your data.&lt;/p&gt;
